A clear statement of the question you're asking
*How is score affected by **1-point crossover compared to 2-point crossover***

A reminder of which framework your using
What set of knapsack problems you plan on comparing these two approaches on?
*we will use both a random seed and also a completely random seed for both approaches and a control*

How many runs you plan to perform for each combination?
*We plan on 50 runs per combination*

What data do you plan to collect and analyze?
*Collect each of the scores for every run*

How are you planning to collect the data?
*Run the program on both a random seed 30 times and also a set seed for each a **control** program (which will be the original code), one with the **1-point crossover**, and one **2-point crossover** a different way. Put all data into a google sheet and make some graphs.*

Where are you going to put/share the data when you have it?
*We are going to put the data in a google sheet which will be linked in the github.*
