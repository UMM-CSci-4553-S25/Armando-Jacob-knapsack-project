What data do you plan to collect and analyze?
*Collect each of the scores for every run*

How are you planning to collect the data?
*Run the program on a random seed 30 times for each a **control** program (which will be the original code), one with the **[PLACEHOLDER FOR WHAT WE ARE TESTING]** one way, and **[PLACEHOLDER FOR WHAT WE ARE TESTING]** a different way. Put all data into a google sheet and make some graphs.*
